2. Sign in and create a new API key

3. Copy to your `.env` file



### D-ID API (Recommended) 🎬### 🎥 **Professional Video Output**See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

1. Sign up at [D-ID.com](https://www.d-id.com/)

2. Get API key from dashboard  - High-quality video generation

3. Add to `.env` file

*Free credits available, then pay-per-use*- Video player with controls### `npm run eject`



### RunwayML API (Optional) 🚀- Download and share capabilities

1. Sign up at [RunwayML.com](https://runwayml.com/)

2. Access API credentials in dashboard- Fullscreen viewing mode**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

3. Add to `.env` for enhanced features



## 🎯 How to Use

## 🚀 Quick StartIf you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### 1. Upload Photo 📸

- Drag & drop or click to select image

- **Best results**: Clear, well-lit face looking toward camera

- **Formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP (max 10MB)### PrerequisitesInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

- **Size**: 512x512 to 1024x1024 pixels recommended



### 2. Select Emotion 🎭  

Choose from 8 emotional styles:- Node.js 18+ and npmYou don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
